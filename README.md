# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction App

## 📝 Introduction

This application predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as passenger class, age, fare, and more. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model trained on historical Titanic passenger data. 

The app provides an intuitive interface for users to input passenger details and receive instant predictions with probability scores. Additionally, it showcases insightful visualizations about survival patterns based on different passenger attributes.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run this application, you'll need the following Python packages:
- 📊 streamlit
- 🐼 pandas
- 🔢 numpy
- 🥒 pickle
- 📈 matplotlib
- 🌊 seaborn
- 🤖 scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)

You can install all requirements using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📂 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venu419/Logistic-Regression.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```

### 📥 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Enter passenger details (class, age, fare, family members, etc.)
2. Click "Predict Survival"
3. View the prediction result and probability
4. Explore the visualization showing survival probability distribution
5. Check out additional insights about survival rates by passenger class and sex
